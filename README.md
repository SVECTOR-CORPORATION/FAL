# FAL: Framework for Automated Labeling

## Overview

**FAL (Framework for Automated Labeling)** is an innovative video classification model designed to automate the process of labeling video content with high precision. Leveraging **self-attention mechanisms**, FAL captures spatial and temporal dependencies across video frames without relying on convolutional operations, providing a more scalable and computationally efficient solution for video understanding.

FAL is built on the **FAL-500 dataset**, a proprietary collection of 500 diverse video categories, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in video classification tasks.

## Key Features

- **Self-attention based**: FAL completely replaces convolutions with self-attention mechanisms to process spatiotemporal video data.
- **High precision**: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in video labeling, identifying actions, scenes, and objects.
- **Scalability**: Can scale efficiently to large video datasets.
- **Versatile**: Suitable for various applications like video content classification, action recognition, scene detection, and more.
- **Efficiency**: Reduces computational overhead by replacing convolutions with scalable self-attention layers.

## Model Description

### Introduction

FAL uses **self-attention mechanisms** inspired by **Transformer** models to classify and label video content. This method allows the model to process long-range dependencies in both space and time, overcoming the limitations of traditional **CNN-based** approaches in video modeling.

- **Problem**: Video data has complex spatial and temporal dependencies that CNNs struggle to capture efficiently, especially over long sequences.
- **Solution**: FAL replaces convolutions with self-attention to capture these dependencies more effectively, enabling better classification of objects, actions, and events in video data.

### Model Architecture

The FAL model consists of the following components:

 Figure 1. The video self-attention blocks that we investigate in this work. Each attention layer implements self-attention on a specified spatiotemporal neighborhood of frame-level patches (see Figure 2 for a visualization of the neighborhoods). We use
residual connections to aggregate information from different attention layers within each block. A 1-hidden-layer MLP is applied at the
end of each block. The final model is constructed by repeatedly stacking these blocks on top of each other.

Figure 2. Visualization of the five space-time self-attention schemes studied in this work. Each video clip is viewed as a sequence of
frame-level patches with a size of 16 × 16 pixels. For illustration, we denote in blue the query patch and show in non-blue colors its
self-attention space-time neighborhood under each scheme. Patches without color are not used for the self-attention computation of the
blue patch. Multiple colors within a scheme denote attentions separately applied along different dimensions (e.g., space and time for
(T+S)) or over different neighborhoods (e.g., for (L+G)). Note that self-attention is computed for every single patch in the video clip, i.e.,
every patch serves as a query. We also note that although the attention pattern is shown for only two adjacent frames, it extends in the
same fashion to all frames of the clip.

On top of this representation we append a 1-hidden-layer
MLP, which is used to predict the final video classes.
Space-Time Self-Attention Models. We can reduce the
computational cost by replacing the spatiotemporal atten-
tion of Eq. 5 with spatial attention within each frame only
(Eq. 6). However, such a model neglects to capture temporal
dependencies across frames. As shown in our experiments,
this approach leads to degraded classification accuracy com-
pared to full spatiotemporal attention, especially on bench-
marks where strong temporal modeling is necessary.
We propose a more efficient architecture for spatiotemporal
attention, named “Divided Space-Time Attention” (denoted
with T+S), where temporal attention and spatial attention
are separately applied one after the other. This architecture
is compared to that of Space and Joint Space-Time attention
in Fig. 1. A visualization of the different attention models
on a video example is given in Fig. 2. For Divided Attention,
within each block ℓ, we first compute temporal attention by
comparing each patch (p,t) with all the patches at the same spatial location in the other frames:
